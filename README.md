simple
======

Simple is supposed to be a completely obvious and intuitive game library for
Rust. Simple was inspired by [LOVE2D](http://love2d.org). I wrote Simple because
I liked the ease-of-use that LOVE2D provided but I wanted the advantage of a
typed compiler (Rust).

Simple is implemented as a layer on top of [AngryLawyer's
Rust-SDL2](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2) and is NOT written for
performance. Remember: **Simple is a prototyping tool!**
